		<h2>The Project:</h2>
        <p>This rover was my university capstone project. A capstone team of six (four mechanical engineers, and two computer scientists) and an electrical engineer club member updated the previous years robot to make it competition ready. This included redesigning the frame, updating the necessary competition systems (driving, digging, dumping), and experimenting with autonomous driving. </p>
		<p>On this project I re-wired the controls box and removed deprecated systems. Instead of having taped up wiring (to seal it from the simulated lunar dust) I designed an IO shield and installed connectors. This allowed for a modular control box as all of the motors plugged into it instead of wiring directly to components inside. I also programmed the dumping system which was designed from scratch, and implemented it into the existing code base. I worked on communications between the controller on a laptop and the remote rover talking to a router. I also worked with the other computer scientist to begin prototyping an autonomous navigation algorithm. While it was never implemented on the competition rover, it used lidar to map surroundings and calculate where the rover could drive to reach a digging area. </p>

		<h2>At a Glance:</h2>
		<ul>
            <li>Wired and programmed controls for dumping system in Python running on Raspberry Pi</li>
            <li>Re-wired controls box with IO shield to allow easier access to box and seal from lunar dust</li>
			<li>Designed autonomous driving algorithm based on lidar sensor</li>
			<li>Won award for best capstone project</li>
		</ul>
