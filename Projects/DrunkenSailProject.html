		<h2>The Project:</h2>
		<p>As implied in the name, drunken sail is a drinking game meant to be played in person with a group. The game is browser based, and as such, is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The general game play rotates through a group of pirates naming each one pirate captain on their respective turn. They get to add a new rule that is overarching and must be adhered to throughout the game. They then choose to either dig for treasure, or plunder by choosing one of the options and following the instructions on the card. This instruction tells them if they get any gold for their troubles and how much to drink to forget said troubles. Following this is a group card drawn as they sail into port before the next person becomes captain and the game continues. </p>
		<p>While it is fully playable, the game is currently in a very early trial stage. It is very much a prototype, and as such, has horrible graphics and many missing features that would help the game feel less rigid. There is no theme unifying text, and it generally boasts a poor user experience. If it seems like a fun game to play, I intend to add story elements, more game play features and rules, and a unifying theme with nicer backgrounds and a better explained rule set. </p>
