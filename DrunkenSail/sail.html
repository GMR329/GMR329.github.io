            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p class="infoTxt">Walk the plank mutineers! You’ve had enough of Captain Minnow and her horrid ship! You abhorrent scoundrels have only 3 things in common: You love gold, booze, and you think you should be the captain… so why don’t you try? Drunken sail is a drinking game where the mutineers take turns becoming the pirate captain and will dig for treasure and plunder for gold (while drinking along the way). </p>
            <p class="infoTxt">After swimming back to shore and having found refuge in a local tavern, your competition will commence. The current captain will update the Pirate Code which MUST be followed at all times. The party will then go out on a quick pirate expedition under the current captains command where the captain leads a dig or a plunder. Everyone then participates in the ship’s activity as they sail away from the adventure back into port. Play then rotates through all players until 15 gold has been acquired by the best captain. Cheers!</p>
            <h2>Pirate Code</h2>
            <p class="infoTxt">The Pirate Code is the set of rules that must be followed throughout the game. The acting captain at the start of their turn can choose if they want to update the current rule before they set sail. They can allow the fates to inspire them, or completely make up their own rule (that will hopefully, force the others to drink). </p>
            <p class="infoTxt">In addition to player rules, there are 2 rules that remain at all times: </p>
        </div>
        <div class="infoPage2">
            <ul>
                <li class="infoTxt">Parlay: If a crew member feels slighted or cheated by the code, they can vote on if there was a violation. If they are out voted, they drink twice. If they win, they avoid their drink. In the event of a tie, whichever side the captain votes, is the winning side.</li>
                <li class="infoTxt">Disobedience Drink: If at any time the Pirate Code is broken, the crew mate must drink. They must still obey the code while they drink. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Draw Page</h2>
            <p class="infoTxt">The current captain may choose to dig or to plunder. If the captain chooses to dig, they may find treasure beyond their wildest dreams, but also find they may have to drink more, especially when their dig is a bust. Should they choose to plunder, they won’t drink as much, and may find treasure more often, just perhaps not quite as much as they COULD find digging around. Just… stop robbing children. </p>
            <p class="infoTxt">Gold can be added by clicking on the number next to the pirate captains name. If gold must be removed, click on the +/- button left of the names. This toggles addition and removal.</p>
            <h2>Group Task</h2>
            <p class="infoTxt">On the way back into port the crew drinks or plays games to pass the time. Everyone participates in whatever is directed on the card following the dig or plunder event. Once “return to port” has been clicked, it is the next pirates turn to update the pirate code… and if a pirate has failed to follow the code on their turn, it is too late to make amends now. Save the excuses, save the panicked rush to fix your mistake, and save the parlays. DRINK!</p>

            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="infoTxt">This game is still being balanced</li>
                <li class="infoTxt">There will be many bugs</li>
                <li class="infoTxt">This game is not optimized for mobile and looks horrible if the window is resized from roughly a laptop aspect ratio</li>
                <li class="infoTxt">I’d love to add pictures and graphics at some point, but I haven’t gotten around to it</li>
                <li class="infoTxt">If you have awesome ideas for cards, pirate code inspiration, or rules… let me know! </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Clarifications</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="infoTxt">Voting: All players close their eyes and point at who they want to vote for. Then all open their eyes together.</li>
                <li class="infoTxt">Code Precedence: If a new Pirate Code rule conflicts with an old one, the new one takes precedent.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>House Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="infoTxt">Pirates Ire: Every time a new drink is made or poured, add a little bit of the drink (or liquor) to the central cup. The worst captain (with the fewest gold) drinks it at the end of the game. The winner can call a vote in the event of a tie. </li>
                <li class="infoTxt">Declare Seconds: If someone has had too much to drink, or may drink too much, declare yourself their second! Once they hit their limit, drink their drink # - 1. Now everyone get's to keep playing! Cheers to seconds!</li>
